;;; Commentary:

;; Extensions for Verilog Mode:
;;  - Tree-sitter support (requires Emacs 29)
;;  - Improve syntax highlighting
;;  - Hierarchy extraction and visualization via Verilog-Perl `vhier'
;;  - LSP configuration for `lsp-mode' and `eglot'
;;  - Support for many linters in `flycheck'
;;  - Improve `imenu': detect instances and support methods inside classes
;;  - Navigate through instances in a module
;;  - Jump to definition/reference of module at point via `ggtags' and `xref'
;;  - Beautify modules: indent and align parameters and ports (interactively and in batch)
;;  - Extended collection of custom and `yasnippet' templates insertion via `hydra'
;;  - Setup `company' to complete with verilog keywords
;;  - Wrapper functions to make `kill-word' stop at underscores without breaking indentation
